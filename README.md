# Alfresco-JS-Utilities

**PLEASE NOTE: This is a personal development project and is not supported in any way by Alfresco Software Ltd.**

## About
This project aims to provide JavaScript utility functions and classes that can be used across multiple UI frameworks/libraries. This is an experimental project and all code is subject to change until the code is proved suitably useful and reusable. 

Currently it contains the following files:
* lib/Authentication.js - functions for handling client authentication against an Alfresco Repository where session tickets are saved to local storage
* lib/services/NodeService - a service for retrieving Nodes via the V1 REST API
